Peace reigned under protection great empire
Humanity thrived
But every empire must fall
On a beautiful night, the Bloody Moon appeared
Bringing with it the creatures of the night
Despite the grandeur of the empire
It succumbed within a few weeks
It seemed like the end of humanity
But then emerged the Order of Dyrvanias
A group of skilled warriors
After a long battle
The Bloody Moon was sealed
But that was long ago
Today, for many, it's just a legend
But recently...
The Moon has been turning increasingly red
And strange events have begun to occur
